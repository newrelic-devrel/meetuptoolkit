  <summary>How to Scope your Meetup</summary>
  There are meetups that are very specific, focused around a particular framework or technology, such as Javascript and React, while there are more        general meetups that cater towards aspiring startup founders or Tech in General. Create a document that will shape the direction of the meetup moving forward.
