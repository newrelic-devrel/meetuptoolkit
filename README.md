## Define your Meetup
### What is your meetup all about?

<details>
  <summary>How to Scope your Meetup</summary>
  There are meetups that are very specific, focused around a particular framework or technology, such as Javascript and React, while there are more        general meetups that cater towards aspiring startup founders or Tech in General.

- [ ] Scope the Meetup
  - [ ] Who is your target audience?

## Set up your MEETUP
- Buy domain of meetup
- Set up the following with the same handles (for easy marketing abilities)
  - Twitter
  - Github
  - Meetup.com
  - Dev.to
  - Twitch
- Set up an email newsletter (some ideas include buttondown.email, mailchimp)
- *optional* create a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation for your meetup. link here -> https://www.thebalancesmb.com/the-pros-and-cons-of-nonprofit-incorporation-2502270
- Find a co-organizer. We highly recommend having 2 or more organizers for the meetup. 

Step 2 - Setting up your FIRST EVENT
- Find a date and time that would be the best for your audience. 
Make sure to check for any national or religious holidays. Make sure to be inclusive of timezones. 
- Set up your landing page. If possible, use the language/stack relevant to your meetup to construct your site. 
- Install Livestreaming Software (Streamlabs OBS/ Streamyard/ OBS)


Step 3 - Setting up the CFP
- Find a keynote speaker 
- Create a detailed README.md file detailing what you are looking for 
  - Suggested Topics
  - Formatting of the abstract (including word count)
  - Include an example CFP 
  - *Optional* embed a video of a step by step walk through of how to submit a CFP (to encourage first time speakers)
- Reach out to relevant groups of developers on 
  - Regional Developer Slack 
  - Language/Framework Specific Slack
  - Twitter
- Reach out to organizers of meetups similar to the one you are starting
  - Try to get these organizers to help you set up the first event, and get their members to attend the event. 
  
  
- Create a Dropbox link for folks to submit their Talks
  - This way you can download them for the following:
    -Streaming them on Twitch
    -Displaying them on the website


Step 3 - Executing a Social Strategy

- Establish Audience
  - Age
  - Location
  - Job
  - Description 
- Create a content calendar 
 - Example [here](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/)
 - Calendar can be broken up into five categories (Think an excel spread sheet. Ours was in Notion)
  - Date
  - Tweet Draft
  - Tags
  - Engagement Metrics
  - Additional Notes
 
 - Establish goals for the strategy 
  - Example - "Clearly communicate what the Awesome Meetup is and interact with our followers"
 - Schedule Tweets during the most active times for your audience
  - We recommend diversifying the schedule 
  
Step 4 - Day of Meetup

- Do a dry run with coorganizor to make sure audio is properly working
- If you are using a Mac there is additional software you will need to download ( we used [this](https://billykorando.com/2020/04/14/capturing-desktop-and-zoom-audio-in-obs-on-macos/) )
- Organize visual assets in scenes for quick transitions
- Go live!
- Designate someone as the monitor to interact with the chat
- Have fun :) 
- We'll also incorporate a pre/post stream checklist.
