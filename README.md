- Find a co-organizer. We highly recommend having 2 or more organizers for the meetup. 

Step 2 - Setting up your FIRST EVENT
- Find a date and time that would be the best for your audience. 
Make sure to check for any national or religious holidays. Make sure to be inclusive of timezones. 
- Set up your landing page. If possible, use the language/stack relevant to your meetup to construct your site. 
- Install Livestreaming Software (Streamlabs OBS/ Streamyard/ OBS)


Step 3 - Setting up the CFP
- Find a keynote speaker 
- Create a detailed README.md file detailing what you are looking for 
  - Suggested Topics
  - Formatting of the abstract (including word count)
  - Include an example CFP 
  - *Optional* embed a video of a step by step walk through of how to submit a CFP (to encourage first time speakers)
- Reach out to relevant groups of developers on 
  - Regional Developer Slack 
  - Language/Framework Specific Slack
  - Twitter
- Reach out to organizers of meetups similar to the one you are starting
  - Try to get these organizers to help you set up the first event, and get their members to attend the event. 
  
  
- Create a Dropbox link for folks to submit their Talks


Step 3 - Executing a Social Strategy
 - Create a content calendar 
  - Example [here](https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-create-a-social-media-content-calendar/)
  - Calendar can be broken up into five categories
    - Date
    - Tweet Draft
    - Tags
    - Engagement Metrics
    - Additional Notes
 - Establish goals for the strategy 
  - Example - "Clearly communicate what the Awesome Meetup is and interact with our followers"
 - Schedule Tweets during the most active times for your audience
  - We recommend diversifying the schedule
